Modules	Screens Details	Issues details	Query	Answers	Screen status
Driver App (Mobile)	Authentication: Login integrated (same `/auth/login` for all roles). JWT is decoded to extract `roleCode` and `employeeId`; Driver role is auto-detected.	Depends on physical device networking (LAN host + HTTP cleartext allowed).	Is the Driver login flow complete?	Yes: `POST /auth/login` via Redux Toolkit thunk with token persistence, role mapping, and employeeId extraction.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Session: Logout integrated (clears token/state) with confirmation modal and toast.	Role preservation for UX (keep role/roleCode) handled.	What is cleared on logout?	Token + auth-related state is reset; user returns to login flow; toast is shown.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Driver Details API binding: Driver name/employeeId/status are fetched from backend using `employeeId` from JWT.	Response unwrapping implemented (array → first item).	If backend response shape changes, mapping may need updates.	Is Driver profile data dynamic?	Yes: `GET /driver/details/:employeeId` with bearer token; stored in Redux state and bound to UI.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Performance: Driver details fetch is deduplicated to avoid repeated API hits (dev re-render/screen focus).	Repeated requests on multiple mounts were causing extra hits; guard added.	Were API hits repeating?	Yes; now a dedupe guard (loading/succeeded + same employeeId) prevents unnecessary requests.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Driver Profile tab: Header shows dynamic EmployeeName + EmployeeId + Status.	If token is missing employeeId, fallback handling is required.	What is shown on Driver Profile header?	Driver name, employee id, and status are shown dynamically from Redux state.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Driver Profile Info: Detail screen shows dynamic Age/Email/Phone/Address from backend.	Some fields may be null; safe fallbacks are used.	Is Profile Info fully dynamic?	Yes: details are read from Redux; missing fields fall back safely.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Update Driver Profile: Edit screen form is prefilled using navigation params and `react-hook-form` `setValue`.	Prefill depends on passing `driverDetails` via route params.	Is Edit Info prefilled?	Yes: name/age/email/phone/address prefill works; improves UX without UI layout changes.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Change Password: Driver change-password API integrated; mismatch guard; success toast; forced logout (token cleared) after success.	Prevents confirm-password mismatch issues.	What happens after password change?	Success toast is shown and the user is auto-logged out (re-login required).	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Error handling: Consistent thunk error handling + Redux error state; toasts on failure.	Network failures (TypeError) are handled gracefully.	How does the user see errors?	Toasts + Redux error state; no crash, graceful failure paths.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Android networking: Enabled cleartext HTTP + network security config (main + debug) for local backend hits on physical devices.	After native changes, reinstall app is recommended; firewall/binding must allow LAN.	Why did “Network request failed” happen on device?	Cleartext blocked + incorrect host; network config + LAN baseUrl resolved it.	Completed
Driver App (Mobile)	Maps: Driver map screens include Directions polyline + ETA/distance integration.	Directions API key authorization/restrictions required; otherwise warning may appear.	How is the Driver route line drawn?	`MapViewDirections` draws the route and `onReady` updates distance/duration.	In Progress
Driver App (Mobile)	Next: Multi-stop optimized route (pickups → school) for driver runs.	Backend must provide stops/coords; Directions `optimizeWaypoints` support required.	How will “best route” be selected?	Google Directions with `optimizeWaypoints=true` returns the best stop order (time/distance optimized).	Pending
