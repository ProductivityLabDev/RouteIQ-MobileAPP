Modules	Screens Details	Issues details	Query	Answers	Screen status
Parent App (Mobile)	Authentication: Login integrated for all roles using a single API. JWT is decoded to extract `roleCode` and user identifiers; role is auto-mapped (Driver/Retail/Parents).	Depends on correct base URL + physical device networking (HTTP cleartext allowed).	Is the login flow complete?	Yes: `POST /auth/login` integrated via Redux Toolkit thunk with consistent success/failure handling, token persistence, and role detection.	Completed
Parent App (Mobile)	Authentication: Logout implemented. Clears token + auth state and shows a logout toast.	Role/roleCode preservation is required for a smooth UX.	What happens on logout?	Auth state resets, token is cleared, and the user returns to the login flow; logout toast is displayed.	Completed
Parent App (Mobile)	Forgot Password (Step 1): Request password reset by sending only the email in request body.	Depends on email validation and backend response shape.	What happens when the user submits email?	`POST /auth/request-password-reset` is called; on success navigates to OTP screen; on failure shows an error toast.	Completed
Parent App (Mobile)	Forgot Password (Step 2): OTP verification flow integrated (email + OTP).	OTP expiry / attempt limits are handled by backend.	How is OTP verified?	`POST /auth/verify-otp` is called; on success navigates to New Password screen.	Completed
Parent App (Mobile)	Forgot Password (Step 3): Final reset password integrated. Sends only `{ userId, newPassword }`.	Password mismatch issue fixed (no success navigation when passwords don’t match).	What is the final reset password payload?	`POST /auth/reset-password` with `{ userId, newPassword }`; on success shows Success screen; on error shows toast.	Completed
Parent App (Mobile)	Validation fix: New password vs confirm password mismatch blocks submit + shows toast.	—	Is the mismatch glitch fixed?	Yes: submission/navigation is blocked when passwords don’t match; user gets a clear error toast.	Completed
Parent App (Mobile)	Toaster system: Global toasts added for login success/failure, logout, reset-password steps, and password-change success.	Ensure Toast is mounted at app root.	Are toasts visible reliably?	Yes: `react-native-toast-message` is mounted with a custom themed config; success/error/info toasts work.	Completed
Parent App (Mobile)	Android networking: Allowed cleartext HTTP + added network security config (main + debug).	After native changes, reinstall app is recommended.	Why were API calls failing/slower on physical device?	Cleartext restrictions + LAN host/firewall/bind issues; config enables device-to-local-backend connectivity.	Completed
Driver Module (Mobile)	Driver details binding: `/driver/details/:employeeId` integrated; `employeeId` extracted from JWT; Driver Profile + Profile Info + Update Profile prefilled/bound.	Deduplication added to avoid repeated API hits on re-renders.	Where does Driver profile data come from?	Redux thunk fetches driver details; UI binds from Redux state; Update Profile prefilled via route params.	Completed
Driver Module (Mobile)	Driver change password: API integrated; on success shows toast and forces logout (token cleared).	Password mismatch guard added.	What happens after successful password change?	User is logged out, token is cleared, and re-login is required.	Completed
Maps (Mobile)	Route polyline + ETA/distance integration (Google Directions). Route drawing support added to Parent/Driver maps.	Requires Directions API key authorization/restrictions; otherwise warning may appear.	How are route line + ETA calculated?	`MapViewDirections` draws route from origin/destination, and `onReady` updates distance/duration.	In Progress
